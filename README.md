Hi there, my name is Sadia Sleweon and welcome to my GitHub!

When I am not coding away on the computer, I enjoy cooking, reading and nature activities. 
As an ENFP personality type I am conceptual, open minded, analytical and insightful. 
As a result, I am a "natural enthusiast and creator of new inventions and insights". 
I am particularly interested in a space that is pioneered by the intersections of math, public health and medicine. 
I enjoy programming and creating meaningful stories through the use of data and/or numbers.
I fuel my passion by explaining public health challenges through the creation of mathematical models, data visual dashboards, spreadsheets and wrangling data. 
I have experience in managing databases, data science, epidemiology, data analysis, and statistical research methods. 
Languages and tools that I am most proficient in include SQL, PowerBi, Tableau,Python, SAS, HTML, JavaScript, R, Gitbash and C++. 

 I'm happy to chat about all things data via email at sadiasleweon@yahoo.com
